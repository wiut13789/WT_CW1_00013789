# Project

## 1. Description

The web-site created is about the Sodiq Academy, which was opened in 2009. The specialized subjects of the academy are Russian, Math SAT, English, and Chemistry. There are 6 pages (About us, Courses, Registration, Teachers, Contacts). The pages were created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to be completely functional and user-friendly.
The user can read a brief description of the academy and learn about the disciplines it teaches on the first page, which is where they initially access the site.
The "About us" page, which introduces the school and provides a brief history and evolution of the Sodiq Academy, is the website's second page. On the third page, there is a table with all the information about the course, including the cost and the instructor's name. Using JavaScript, the table for the "Courses" page was created. Given that the user's contact information is preserved in the console, the registration page is regarded as the fourth page, where JavaScript performs the most of the work. The teacher who works at the Academy is described on the fifth page. There are lines about the professors' work history and honors beneath their pictures. The location and contacts are on the last page, which also includes a map and contact information.
